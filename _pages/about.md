My name is Minhua Lin (林敏华), I am an incoming PhD Student in [Deapartment of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I am fortunate to be advisored by Prof. [Shiqing Ma](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~sm2283/). My research interests lie at AI security, especially graph adversarial learning.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering's degree from [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://english.cs.hust.edu.cn/) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) in 2021. During my undergraduate year, I worked as a research assistant at Big Data Intelligence Lab, supervised by Prof. Pan Zhou.
