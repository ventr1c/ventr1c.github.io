I am a forth-year PhD student in [the College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My advisors are [Prof. Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/) and [Prof. Xiang Zhang](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/xzz89/). I received my bachelor degree of engineering in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) in 2021. My research interests lie in large language models, graph learning, trustworthy AI, and their intersections.
